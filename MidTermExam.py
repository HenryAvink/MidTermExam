print("Once apon a time I built my second ever computer.\nIt is way better than the first one I build and I use it almost every day.\nWhile I was building it, I got stuck a few times but in the end I got it finished and all working.\nI now use it to run game on my monitors and on my VR headset, the Valve Index.\nIt works really well.")
